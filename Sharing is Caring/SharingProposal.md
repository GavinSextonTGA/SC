# Celeste Music Generator
## Why use you're DAW or Ai, when you can make randomly generated Celeste music with *ease*
# What this entails/Goal
2-3 subtractive synths based off of the synths for the soundtrack of my favorite game, Celeste. Maybe a piano that is played via MIDI out, but honestly I want to focus on the 3 synths.
## What are these synths?
### Synth 1: Bass!
The celeste bass (from the track ressurections specifically) is a monophonic saw wave with that slides between pitches and has a lot of distortion, pink noise and bitcrushed,with an Sin LFO controlling its high pass filter, and some reverb, all of which I THINK can be done within supercollider.
### Synth 2: The LEAD
The lead is a bit more complex and might need some more concessions, it has 3 oscillators, a sin_square wave (closer to sin), an octave higher than the base sound, second is the same but even closer to sin in the main octave, and the third is a square wave an octave down, all with pink noise, bitcrushed, with some reverb and delay.
### Synth 3? Arps!
  This one is more tricky as Lena Raine, the composer, doesn't have a tutorial on how to make this sound, but if I get to it its basically a high square wav that lays out an arpeggio of the current chord
## What to do with these synths?
  I'm not sure whether to set a scale or outline a chord progression, also filters based on mouse x and mouse y would be amazing! Though making the sounds seems difficult as well so we will see about this implementation. I would like for when they play and what octave they play to be randomized tho!
